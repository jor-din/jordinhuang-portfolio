            <h2>Why Software Engineer?</h2>
            <p>
              Before I found my interest in software engineering, I was a health
              science major at Boston University on track to becoming a nurse.
              During my last semester of Senior, I decided to take 'CS111:
              Introduction to Computer Science' out of curiosity. From that
              class, my admiration for technology and dedication to contributing
              to the groundbreaking industry became the reason why I decided to
              leave the healthcare path.
            </p>

            <p>
              Since then, I have tried every route to becoming a software
              engineer. Ranging from Udemy courses, Youtube, and even attending
              a semester at Oregon State University. I realized I needed an
              environment where I could practice effective teamwork and
              communication as a software engineer. So I took my chances and
              attended General Assembly - Software Engineer Immersive. Since
              August 2022, I have officially graduated from the program and have
              become more confident and motivated to continue learning and
              growing as an engineer.

                <strong>‚úàÔ∏è Travel: </strong>During college, I would save up all my money and travel during winter breaks and spring breaks. After my first international trip, I discovered my love for exploring and embracing different cultures and understanding different perspectives in life. Since then I have found great travel buddies to share precious moments and hope to travel more soon.

Now during the weekends, I love looking for new recipes to try out and share with family and friends. Recently I have been obsessed with using puff pastry to make tartlets and turnovers.
